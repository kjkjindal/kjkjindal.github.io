I am an aspiring researcher in the field of synthetic biology and deep learning. I was recently a visiting research fellow at the [George Church laboratory](http://arep.med.harvard.edu) at the [Department of Genetics](https://genetics.hms.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard Medical School](https://hms.harvard.edu/) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/)
Synthetic biology is a highly exciting field of bioengineering propelled by the advancements in DNA sequencing and synthesis methods in the last two decades. I am broadly interested in working at the interface of deep learning and synthetic biology to develop next generation high throughput methods for fundamental biological research.
